# Car Damage Detection using YOLO V1
D:\Car Damage Detection\1_C9H_3I3v4voI0UzvQNuD0w.webp

This project implements a deep learning model for detecting car damage using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 1 algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that is capable of detecting multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed. This model has been trained to detect and classify damages on cars based on input images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify and localize different types of damage on car bodies using YOLO V1. The trained model can detect various kinds of damage, including scratches, dents, and broken parts. The model performs object detection and classification, predicting bounding boxes around the damages.

### Features

- Detects car damage from images using a deep neural network.
- Real-time damage localization with YOLO V1.
- Provides bounding boxes and classification of damage.
  
## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-damage-detection.git
   cd car-damage-detection
   ```

2. Install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Required packages include:

   - TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on your deep learning framework)
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib

3. Download the pre-trained YOLO V1 weights from the official [YOLO V1 GitHub repository](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) or train the model from scratch as mentioned below.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of damaged cars. You can use an open-source dataset like:

- **[Car Damage Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/car-damage-detection)** available on Kaggle.
  
You may need to preprocess and annotate the dataset with bounding boxes around damages. You can use [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) to label the images manually if a labeled dataset is not available.

## Model Architecture

This project uses the YOLO V1 (You Only Look Once) architecture, which divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.

- **Input Image**: The input image is divided into an SxS grid.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes, object confidence, and class probabilities.
- **Class Prediction**: The class with the highest probability is selected.

## Training

To train the YOLO V1 model on the car damage dataset:

1. Download or prepare the dataset (as explained above).
2. Modify the training parameters in the configuration file (`yolo_v1_config.py`).
3. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config yolo_v1_config.py
   ```

### Training Hyperparameters

- **Batch size**: 64
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Learning rate**: 0.001
- **Optimizer**: Adam

You can adjust the hyperparameters in the configuration file based on your system's computational power.

## Testing

To test the trained model on new images, run the following script:

```bash
python test.py --image /path/to/image.jpg --weights /path/to/weights
```

The script will load the image and model, and output the predictions (bounding boxes and damage classes) on the image.

## Results

The YOLO V1 model shows good performance on car damage detection with an mAP (mean Average Precision) of 75% on the test dataset.

### Example Output

![Example Output](example_output.png)

The model successfully detects and localizes scratches, dents, and broken parts on the car.

## Usage

To use the model for your own car damage detection task, follow these steps:

1. Download the pre-trained weights or train the model on your own dataset.
2. Use the testing script to make predictions on new images.
3. Visualize the results with bounding boxes and damage class labels.

```bash
python detect.py --image /path/to/car/image.jpg --output /path/to/output
```

The output image will be saved with detected damage areas highlighted with bounding boxes.
